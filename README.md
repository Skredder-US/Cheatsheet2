I decided to return to this project and make it pixel perfect using the DevTools. 

After some looking at their class names I think they're using some design/layout program to create this webpage instead of writing the html and css themselves. I'm sure it's some tool that makes creating this webpage much better. I decided to complete the header nav anyways, it was still fun.

I'd rather learn the software they're using because that's how they did it.
